# Indepth Golang: Resources and Notes
---
I was hanging out at work for a little after-hours learning/coding this past 
Friday, when, in IRC, user Kharybs on #go-nuts asked, ["Anyone know where I can 
find documentation on the structure of the Go source?"](
https://botbot.me/freenode/go-nuts/2014-08-08/?msg=19404931&page=13) 

After providing kharybs some general links, I started to think that it 
wouldn't be a bad thing if I went and reread the Go 
[Spec](http://golang.org/ref/spec) and [Memory Model](
http://golang.org/ref/mem) documents, since I'd read them as I was just 
learning the language. Plus, there were additional talks and documents I'd 
linked that looked great, but hadn't yet reviewed.

So, today (Saturday), I'm starting to work through them; and will update this 
post with links to highlights and/or notes for the larger resources as I do.
